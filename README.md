# NPS_WSD

Project to develop and explore the NPS Water Supply Database (WSD).

This repository contains functions and scripts used to explore and populatie metadata for the NPS Water Supply Database and to tabulate and view database progress. Several functions were copied directly over from the parent project at: <https://github.com/rossyndicate/nps_water_vulnerability>. Several of the scripts were developed by interns that worked on the database and as such, the style and code are unique to their individualized skillsets, preferences, and workflows.

Explore_WSD.Rmd is a good starting place for anyone wanting to explore the database and various utility functions contained within this repository.

Note, all of these scripts require access to the Colorado State University & NPS shared data directory, which is restricted to project partners at this time. If you are a project partner and require access to this directory, please email kristen.cognac\@colostate.edu.
